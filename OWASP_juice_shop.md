Admin registration- Go to user registration frm the login page. Have burp running in bg. We see a post request on submitting the details, we see the attribute 'role' which is customer right now. We can add this role attribute as admin in a new request which we forward using repeater and the challenge is solved. 

Bjoern's favourite pet- If we google Bjoern Kimminich's name we get a youtube video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lu0-kDdtVf4 in which he mentions the name of his cat as Zaya and email id as bjoern@owasp.org
