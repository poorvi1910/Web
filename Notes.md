- Python Magic methods are the methods starting and ending with double underscores ‘__’. They are defined by built-in classes in Python and commonly used for operator overloading. 
They are also called Dunder methods, Dunder here means “Double Under (Underscores)”.
- Name Mangling : interpreter of the Python alters the variable name in a way that it is challenging to clash when the class is inherited.
- -  __name: Double Pre Underscores are used for the name mangling.Double Pre Underscores tells the Python interpreter to rewrite the attribute name of subclasses to avoid naming conflicts.
- __init__ : method to initiate object
- __del__ : destructor method. It is called after an object’s garbage collection occurs, which happens after all references to the item have been destroyed.
- __repr__ : defines how an object is presented as a string.
- __str__ : returns a human-readable, or informal, string representation of an object
- __call__: The __call__ method enables Python programmers to write classes where the instances behave like functions and can be called like a function
- __len__ :When the object doesn’t have a predefined __len__ method, then while executing the len function it gives a TypeError, but it can be corrected by defining a __len__ method by our own
- __getitem__ : when used in a class, allows its instances to use the [] (indexer) operators.this method is used to access the items from the list, dictionary, and array.
- __setitem__ :  used to assign the values to the item. When we assign or set a value to an item in a list, array, or dictionary, this method is called internally.
- __delitem__ :  deletes the items in the list, dictionary, or array
